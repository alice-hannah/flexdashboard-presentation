## Background and Motivation

- Quarterly management reports for [Dementia Post Diagnostic Support (PDS)](https://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Mental-Health/Dementia-Post-diagnostic-Support/) data

- SPSS used for data preparation and calculating performance measures

- Excel used to present data

- New data recording guidance prompted review of methodology and presentation of management reports


## Why flexdashboard?

- Process can be automated using R and R Markdown

- Output can include interactive elements

- Output as a stand alone html file

    - Universal file format
    - No requirement for password protected shiny server
    - Can continue to be distributed via email to restrict access

- Looks swish!


## Using flexdashboard

Define output as flexdashboard in YAML header of R Markdown document:

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Dementia PDS Quarterly Management Report"
output: 
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    navbar:
      - title: "Data as at 31 December 2019"
    logo: isdscotland.png
    orientation: rows
    vertical_layout: scroll
---
```


## Using flexdashboard

Add a new row...

```{r eval = FALSE}
Row
-------------------------------------------------
```

Add multiple pages...

```{r eval = FALSE}
Home
=================================================
```

Create a tabset to switch between sections...
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
Row {.tabset}
-------------------------------------------------
```


## Using flexdashboard

```{r eval = FALSE}
flexdashboard::valueBox(paste0(80, "%"), 
                        icon = "fa-percent",
                        caption = paste("of people estimated to be newly",
                                        " diagnosed with dementia were referred",
                                        " for post-diagnostic support.")
)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "valuebox.png"))
```


## R Markdown Child Templates

- Used to create multiple pages with the same layout for each financial year and health board, thus avoiding duplication of code

- Write separate R Markdown document called a "child" template

- Use `knitr::knit_child()` in the main markdown document to knit the "child" template for each combination of parameters

## Next Steps

- Automate date in navbar so dashboard is fully automated

- Improve comments/documentation of code

- Develop further data analysis

- Develop as shiny dashboard when infrastructure available
