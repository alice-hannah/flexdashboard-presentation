## What is unit testing?

- Unit testing involves testing code to ensure it does what it's supposed to do

- It is an important concept in software development

- In the context of R, unit testing normally involves testing whether the output of functions are as expected

- If you've never heard of unit testing, but do write R functions, chances are you already do informal unit testing


## Why do unit testing?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "pill-test.jpg"))
```

## Why do unit testing?

- Provides evidence that your code works as intended - useful for anyone else who uses it, or yourself in future

- If you find a bug in the code, unit tests are a way of checking that it has been resolved

- If you make amendments to the code in future, re-running existing unit tests is a way of checking you haven't inadvertently broken anything that used to work

- Forces you to break large, unwieldy sections of code up into smaller, more manageable functions


## The testthat package

- "_Testing should be something that you do all the time, but itâ€™s normally painful and boring_" - [Hadley Wickham](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf)

- The [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) package provides functions to automate unit testing

- It's designed with package development in mind, but there's no reason it can't be used to test functions in standalone scripts

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "25%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics(here::here("images", "testthat_logo.png"))
```


## The testthat package

The most prominent functions in testthat are the `expect_` functions:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(testthat)

expect_equal(2 + 3, 5)
expect_error(sum(1, "two"))
```

If these tests are run individually and pass, they return no output. They return an error message if they fail:

```{r, error = TRUE}
expect_lt(3, 2)
```


## A practical example

Imagine you want to calculate the number of instances of a particular day in a set time period (motivation: the [HSMR publication](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/hsmr) goes out on the third last Tuesday of the month, every three months). You could do it 'manually' every time:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(lubridate)

# Number of Tuesdays in January 2018
sum(format(seq(dmy(01012018), dmy(31012018), by = "day"), "%w") == 2)

# Number of Thursdays in 2020
sum(format(seq(dmy(01012020), dmy(31122020), by = "day"), "%w") == 4)
```


## A practical example

If you have to do this lots of times, for different time periods, it's easier, safer and all-round better to write a function:

```{r}
n_day <- function(start, end, n) {
  
  if (any(class(c(start, end)) != "Date")) {
    stop("The start and end dates must be in date format")
  }
  
  # Note that Sunday is considered to be day 0; not day 7
  if (!n %in% 0:6) {
    stop("The day of the week must be a number between 0 and 6")
  }
  
  sum(format(seq(start, end, by = "day"), "%w") == n)
}
```


## A practical example

You can then call that function:

```{r}
# Number of Tuesdays in January 2018
n_day(dmy(01012018), dmy(31012018), 2)

# Number of Thursdays in 2020
n_day(dmy(01012020), dmy(31122020), 4)
```


## A practical example

You might do some informal checks that the function works as expected:

```{r, error = TRUE, linewidth = 90}
# Check that n_day errors if not supplied with a valid n
n_day(dmy(01012020), dmy(31122020), 7)

# Check that n_day produces at least 52 instances of every day in 2020
unlist(purrr::map(0:6, ~ n_day(dmy(01012020), dmy(31122020), .x)))
```


## A practical example

But writing formal, automated tests is better:

```{r}
test_that("Errors if supplied with input of incorrect class", {
  expect_error(n_day(dmy(01012020), dmy(31122020), 7))
})

test_that("Produces at least 52 instances of every day in 2020", {
  instances <- unlist(purrr::map(0:6, ~ n_day(dmy(01012020), dmy(31122020), .x)))
  
  expect_true(all(instances >= 52))
})
```


## A practical example

```{r}
test_file(here::here("code", "03_test-n_day.R"))
```
